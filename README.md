# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

**Background**<br><br>
Bobby's manager has given both of you two more assignments: determine the number of retiring employees per title and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. Pewlett-Hackard would like to launch a new mentoring program with employees eligible to retire in the near future. Instead of having a large chunk of their workforce retiring, they want to introduce a mentoring program: experienced and successful employees stepping back into a part-time role instead of retiring completely. Then, summarizes your analysis in order to help  Bobby’s manager prepare for the “silver tsunami” as many current employees reach retirement age.  Since Pewlett-Hackard has no real database or data management system in place, understanding the data we are working with and finding the connections within is a huge step.<br><br>
**Overview of the analysis**<br><br>
Our first assignment is to create a Retirement Titles table that contain all the titles of current employees who were born between January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1955. Some employees have had multiple titles in the database—for example, due to promotions—we will need to create a table that contains the most recent title of each employee. Then, we will create a final table that has the number of retirement-age employees by most recent job title.<br><br>
The second leg of our assignment will be to create a mentorship-eligibility table that holds the current employees who were born between January 1, 1965 and December 31, 1965.  The current employee pool will be extracted from the nine departments that Pewlett-Hackard allocates their employees in respectively.<br><br>

**Results**<br><br>
•	**Employees Eligible for Retirement**<br><br>
The first major point we can draw from the Retiring Titles report we created is that 30% of the employees are eligible for retirement.  That is an astounding number to digest as well as plan an effective succession plan.  <br>

What the data also tells us is that 64% of the Retiring Titles are comprised of Senior Level Employees and if we look at it from the big picture of Pewlett-Hackard, that is total represents 19% of their current workforce.<br><br>

**Summary**<br><br> 
•	How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?<br><br>
•	Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?<br><br>
Years of industry experience will be important to review from each employee but I believe years of experience at Pewlett Hackard needs to be examined carefully.<br><br>
Pewlett-Hackard has fallen behind in the database department, so it will be a huge achievement to get this organized for the company.  They are using their lead indicating data as a lagging indicator and it is paramount that they implement an HR software that houses professional certifications as well as industry training that the employee has attended and earned proper credit.   The trainings or certifications should be geared towards their industry specialty or an in-house HR training that they are required to take as leaders or senior staff.  Data integrity is the quality of the data we are working with and that also needs to apply to our employee data to maximize our return on investments as a company since our employees are our greatest investment. Clean data will yield better results in analysis and maintaining the data integrity ensures greater accuracy, reliability, and highest return on our employee investment. Workday will significantly improve HR and Payroll compliance, reduce risk, provide better data for decision making, and increase efficiencies across the institution. It will also enable people across the University to work more efficiently by having consistent, streamlined, and modern practices.  I have attached the five benefits of using Workday here in the Pewlett-Hackard [WORKDAY](https://www.workday.com/en-us/pages/infostudy-bredin-fast-track-to-growth-hr.html) recommendation.
