# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

**Background**<br><br>
Now that Bobby has proven his SQL chops, his manager has given both of you two more assignments: determine the number of retiring employees per title and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. Then, summarizes your analysis in order to help  Bobby’s manager prepare for the “silver tsunami” as many current employees reach retirement age.  Understanding the data we are working with and finding the connections within is a huge step.<br><br>

Pewlett-Hackard has fallen behind in the database department, so it will be a huge achievement to get this organized for the company.  They are using their lead indicating data as a lagging indicator and it is paramount that they implement an HR software that houses professional certifications as well as industry training that the employee has attended and earned proper credit.   The trainings or certifications should be geared towards their industry specialty or an in-house HR training that they are required to take as leaders or senior staff.  Data integrity is the quality of the data we are working with. Clean data will yield better results in analysis and maintaining the data integrity ensures greater accuracy and reliability.
